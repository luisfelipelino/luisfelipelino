- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @luisfelipelino. I'm a full-stack developer and WordPress enthusiast.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Design, UI/UX design, PHP, JS, and WordPress development. Besides that, I love to practice sports, play video games and drink beer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning some PHP and JS. Because I love it, and it pays my bills. Now I'm learning C++ too. At baby steps, but learning.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at luisfelipelino@gmail.com or at https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisfelipelino.
